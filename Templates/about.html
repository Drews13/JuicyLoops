        <p>
            JuicyLoops aims to create a database of free audio snippets, samples, recordings released under Creative Commons licenses that allow their reuse. JuicyLoops provides new and interesting ways of accessing these samples, allowing users to:
        </p>    
        <ul>
            <li>browse the sounds in new ways using keywords, a "sounds-like" type of browsing and more</li>
            <li>upload and download sounds to and from the database, under the same creative commons license</li>
            <li>interact with fellow sound-artists!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>    
            We also aim to create an open database of sounds that can also be used for scientific research. Using the JuicyLoops researchers and developers can access JuicyLoops content a retrieve meaningful sound information such as metadata, analysis files and the sounds themselves. JuicyLoops usage is free for non-commercial use.
